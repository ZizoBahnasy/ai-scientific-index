Human: You are an expert in the scientific research process. Your job is to classify how the user is interacting with the AI assistant based on the following modes:

- "AUTONOMOUS_TASK": The user is instructing the AI to perform a specific, well-defined task on its own (e.g., "Analyze this data and plot the results," "Write Python code to simulate this process").
- "COLLABORATIVE_PARTNER": The user is engaging the AI in a creative or exploratory dialogue (e.g., "What are some novel hypotheses to explain this phenomenon?," "Let's brainstorm potential experimental designs").
- "EDUCATIONAL_TOOL": The user is asking the AI to explain, summarize, or teach a scientific concept (e.g., "Explain how CRISPR-Cas9 works," "What's the difference between a T-test and an ANOVA?").

Which mode best describes the user's interaction? You MUST provide one of the three options exactly as written above.

Assistant: Sure, the answer to the question is: <answer>
